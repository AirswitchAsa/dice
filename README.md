### This is open-sourced by [Spicadust Inc.](https://www.spicadust.com) and hosted [here](https://www.spicadust.com/dice).
### Dice is a side project out of our first product [Sphaere](https://dev.sphaere.app), a modern tool to manage information retrieval and organization.

Generate customizable dithered gradient backgrounds directly in the browser and export them as PNG images. The project is built on the two awesome packages [@paper-design/shaders](https://github.com/paper-design/shaders) and [@ruucm/shadergradient](https://github.com/ruucm/shadergradient).

## Development

```bash
cd dice
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to tweak gradient and dithering parameters with live preview and download the rendered image at any resolution.
