# Dice – Dithered Canvas Engine

Generate customizable dithered gradient backgrounds directly in the browser and export them as PNG images. This project reuses the background tooling from Sphaere and packages it into a standalone Next.js single-page app.

## Getting started

```bash
cd dice
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to tweak gradient and dithering parameters with live preview and download the rendered image at any resolution.
